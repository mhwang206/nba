Problem:
  Document not found for class User with attributes {:username=>""}.
Summary:
  When calling User.find_by with a hash of attributes, all attributes provided must match a document in the database or this error will be raised.
Resolution:
  Search for attributes that are in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document not found for class User with attributes {:username=>"dsf"}.
Summary:
  When calling User.find_by with a hash of attributes, all attributes provided must match a document in the database or this error will be raised.
Resolution:
  Search for attributes that are in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error.):
